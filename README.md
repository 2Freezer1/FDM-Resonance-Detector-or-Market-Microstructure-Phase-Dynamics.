Technical Abstract: Empirical Detection of Resonance Collapse Boundaries in Complex Systems
​Project: Fragility Detection Model (FDM) v9.4
Theoretical Framework: CRONOS-Blockmatrix Theory (C-BMT)
​Abstract
​This project presents a computational apparatus designed to test the Minimum Cost Principle of information coherence in non-equilibrium complex systems. Using high-frequency financial market data (BTC/USDT) as a proxy for a high-consensus quantum field, the Fragility Detection Model (FDM) investigates the mechanics of State Selection and Wave Function Collapse.
​The model operates on the hypothesis that reality does not emerge linearly but is selected from a Hilbert space of potentials (\mathcal{M}) based on energetic efficiency. This selection process is governed by the C-BMT state equation:
E_{Det} = k (\Delta\rho)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta S}{N_{eff}} + \delta_Q

Where:
​N_{eff} (Consensus): Mapped to Market Volume/Liquidity. High N stabilizes the standing wave.
​\delta_Q (Quantum Flux): Mapped to Normalized Volatility. This represents the background entropy or "temperature" of the system.
​\rho (Resonance Density): Mapped to the autoregressive structure (SARIMAX order) of the time series.
​Methodology: The Inertial Grid Search
​Unlike traditional stochastic modeling, FDM v9.4 employs an Adaptive Inertia algorithm. The model identifies a "Stable Reality" (optimal p,d,q parameters) and maintains this structure so long as the Information Criterion (AIC) remains within a specific entropic bound.
​A Phase Transition (Recalibration) is only triggered when system entropy spikes (\delta_Q \uparrow), signifying a "Resonance Shift." This mimics the physical principle of conservation of energy—the system resists structural change until the cost of maintaining the old structure exceeds the cost of shifting to a new one.
​Empirical Results (Null Hypothesis Test)
​In a continuous 12.5-hour observation window (Nov 22, 2025), the system demonstrated Hyper-Stability:
​Structural Persistence: The model maintained a single resonance state (1,1,1) without recalibration, validating the "Inertia" hypothesis.
​Entropy Decay: The thermodynamic risk metric decayed from 4.8 \to 1.3 as the system cooled, accurately predicting a "Drift" phase rather than a "Collapse" event.
​No-Trade Theorem: The model successfully filtered out low-consensus noise, validating that without a critical threshold of Resonance Density (\rho), no coherent "Future" path is selected.
​Conclusion
​The FDM serves as a Resonance Detector, providing empirical evidence that financial markets follow scale-invariant laws of thermodynamics and quantum selection. This suggests that "Price Discovery" is an isomorphic process to "Wave Function Collapse," driven by collective observer consensus (N).
